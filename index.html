            the most influential Latin entertainer in North America. In 2012, Forbes ranked her the world's most

            influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 include "If
            You Had My Love", "I'm Real", "Ain't It Funny", "All I Have", and "On the Floor". For her contributions to
            the recording industry, she has a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and has received the
